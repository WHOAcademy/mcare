Minutes of Life Added (or lost)

## Minutes of Life Added Algorithm

* Column B: Intervention
* 101-125: Basic interventions that should be available at any emergency trauma facility
* 130-140: Interventions that may require additional training
* 150-163: Trauma Imaging: Xrays/Radiographs are basic, CT and MRI are standard in higher resourced settings, Ultrasound in Trauma (FAST Scan) normally only available in trauma facilities
* 180-198: Abbreviated from a Delphi Study into Life and Limb saving interventions
* 210-214: High resource settings may be able to do these procedures in their emergency units however, usually, if these interventions are available they will take place in the operating theatre/specialised theatre
place in the operating theatre/specialised theatre
* 220-226: Are included for completeness, although unlikely to feature in early of the MCARE game

## Basic Rules

### Tasks can be:

* Doctor can achieve the task independently
* Nurse can achieve the task independently
* Both Doctor and Nurse required
* May be consecutive or concurrent, but this detail has been excluded at present

### Times in the table are in real time

* ‘Average’ Doctor or Nurse with no distractions

### There may be a delay before the requested task takes effect

* Example: IV Blood is given and takes 2 mins before blood pressure starts to rise

## Patient response to intervention

* If the correct treatment is administered, a blood transfusion and there is a volume related drop in blood pressure, then the player is rewarded with minutes added to the patient’s life timer
* If an unnecessary treatment is administered, minutes are neither added nor lost, however, the player will have wasted time in carrying out the intervention which effectively reduces the patient’s life timer
* If a detrimental treatment is administered;
** Life can be reduced by x minutes
** May cause patient to die as time to carry out intervention exceeds life remaining in the life timer

## Caveats (aka real patients don’t behave as you expect)

### Columns U and V reflect real life.
* Patients don’t behave as you expect/want them to
* Column U describes some trauma nuances. An intervention may work in other areas of medicine but have pitfalls in trauma and therefore should be considered as contraindications. But that won’t stop you from trying…
* Column V – additional notes I thought it would be useful for the designers to know

### Patients don’t always behave as you think they should. Sometimes you try something and sometimes it will work. Sometimes, it works for you once and you do it again as a last resort, praying that another miracle will happen.
* Potential for this to be exploited using Game Seƫngs/Randomiser
