# MCARE Avatars, Selfies and Login

Create a test app that lets the player take a selfie or choose an avatar from a library of images. 

AR glasses can't be turned around like a phone to take a selfie. In the AR environment, players without the hardware to take selfies of themselves may be able to take photos of others. Players wearing glasses to take pictures of each other and assign the photo/avatar to the right player. For players on phones, taking selfies is an option. 

For login, keying in passwords is a no-go. No keyboard. Hospital workers typically have ID cards. We will OCR their badges for login. The player presents an ID card with a QR or barcode on it. Read their existing hospital ID card, if they have one. We'll create physical ID cards for those of us who don't have hospital IDs.
