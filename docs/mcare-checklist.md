# MCARE Checklist

@Miguel Ribeiro will you build the following?
1. Create Checklist widget based on Panel. Given a list of up to 6 choices, Checklist returns the number of the choice selected or zero if escape/back.
2. Record session. PNG image snapshots and as video.
3. Create ER, OR and patient rooms. Simple, four walls, textured (from JJ?). Dress rooms with bed or an operating table. We'll want to render these VR rooms in real-time and display in a 2D video window on player's screen, as though being in a Zoom call. So players can see what's happening in the ER and OR. Players or NPCs in these rooms able to call players at table top to ask questions.

@Justine (JJ) Lee will you snap images of ER, OR and patient rooms for @Miguel Ribeiro to use as textures? One photo of each wall, at least 4 per room.
